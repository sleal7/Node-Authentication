# Node-Authentication

## Delete Later:
1. Changed GitHub password
2. GitHub signin for the popup window that comes up after typing git push, does not signin properly no matter what. Don't use git bash, use cmd prompt and that window will pop up, signin will fail, and then in the cmd prompt it will give you the ability to sign in. The password section doesn't look like it is working, but it is just hiding what you are typing.
